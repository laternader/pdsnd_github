### Project Title
SHA in Bikeshare Statistics (Github Lessons in Practice)

### Description
The code will take in the user's input and filter out the data that they do
not want. Upon doing so, the code is computing descriptive statistics such as
common age of bike users, the most common bike trips, the average time per bike
trip, and/or the most popular month of bikes being used. The code takes into
account any errors from the user and does not crash. The code also outputs
(if the user desires) the raw data of the filters they used.

### Files used
chicago.csv, washington.csv, new_york_city.csv
